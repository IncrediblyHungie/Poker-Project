# Pluribus Poker Bot File System Test Report

## Test Summary

This report documents the testing of the file system setup for the Pluribus poker bot project.

## ‚úÖ Successful Tests

### 1. **Environment Setup** ‚úì
- Python 3.12.7 detected and working
- All required external dependencies available:
  - numpy, scipy, scikit-learn
  - joblib, pyyaml, tqdm
  - pypokerengine successfully installed

### 2. **Basic Module Imports** ‚úì
Core engine modules import successfully:
- `engine.game_state` (GameState, Action, BettingRound, Player)
- `engine.action_handler` (ActionHandler)
- `engine.hand_evaluator` (HandEvaluator, Card, Rank, Suit)

### 3. **Configuration Loading** ‚úì
- YAML configuration file loads correctly
- All required sections present:
  - Game settings (blinds, stacks, player limits)
  - Abstraction settings (card buckets, action fractions)
  - Training settings (iterations, checkpoints, threads)

### 4. **Directory Structure** ‚úì
All required directories exist and are writable:
- `data/` and `data/blueprints/` for model storage
- `config/` for configuration files
- `src/` with proper module structure
- `scripts/` with training and playing scripts
- `tests/` for test files

### 5. **File Permissions** ‚úì
- Write access confirmed for data directories
- All script files are present and accessible

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### 1. **Relative Import Problems**
Several modules use relative imports that don't work when scripts are run directly:
- `abstraction.action_abstraction`
- `abstraction.card_abstraction`
- `cfr.linear_cfr`
- `cfr.mccfr`
- `strategy.blueprint_generator`

**Impact**: Training and playing scripts cannot run directly.

**Workaround**: Modules can be imported when the parent directory is in the Python path.

### 2. **Script Execution Issues**
Both `scripts/train.py` and `scripts/play.py` fail due to the relative import problem.

## üß™ Test Results Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Python Environment | ‚úÖ Pass | Python 3.12.7, all dependencies installed |
| Core Modules | ‚úÖ Pass | Engine modules work correctly |
| Configuration | ‚úÖ Pass | YAML config loads and validates |
| Directory Structure | ‚úÖ Pass | All required directories present |
| File Permissions | ‚úÖ Pass | Write access confirmed |
| Module Imports | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Core modules work, advanced modules have import issues |
| Script Execution | ‚ùå Fail | Cannot run training/playing scripts |

## üìã Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Fix Import Structure**: Convert relative imports to absolute imports or add proper `__init__.py` files
2. **Test Script Execution**: Once imports are fixed, test `train.py` and `play.py` functionality
3. **Add Package Installation**: Consider making the project pip-installable to resolve import issues

### For Production Use:
1. **Create Virtual Environment**: Use a dedicated virtual environment
2. **Pin Dependencies**: Use exact versions in `requirements.txt`
3. **Add Integration Tests**: Test end-to-end training and playing workflows
4. **Add CI/CD**: Automate testing for future changes

## üéØ Conclusion

The file system setup is **functional for core components** but needs import fixes for full functionality. The project structure is well-organized and the core poker engine components work correctly. The main blockers are the relative import issues in the advanced modules.

**Overall Status**: üü° **Partially Working** - Core functionality accessible, scripts need import fixes.
